This is a mod I made with MCreator.
The mod's content:
- This mod makes your Minecraft world more realistic as you can get all kinds of diseases. From flu to cancer (my plan)
- There are three reasons why I created this mod:
    + Increase difficulty and make your Minecraft world more interesting.
    + Impacts the player's consciousness to a certain extent. The fact that you suffer from diseases and have to struggle to cure them will make you see the difficulties of patients, showing you how dangerous the disease is. - My poem teacher = )
    + For fun, of course
